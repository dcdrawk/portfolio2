During the reading break, I had some free time which I used to design a simple game to explore programming and game logic with Unity. Based on the classic PC game Chip's Challenge, I wanted to replicate simple actions and functions so I could become more proficient with the Unity editor.</p> </div> <div class="second"> <h3>Process</h3> <p>I started by studying Chip's challenge, and I mapped out the pseudo-code related to certain game functions like picking up a key and unlocking a door. Once I understood, I used my programming, modelling, and research skills in order to bring my vision to life.</p> </div> <div class="third"> <h3>Result</h3> <p>This was a great way to teach myself the basics of Unity. I was able to recreate a classic game while leaning something new and challenging.</p> </div> </div> <div class="imgGallery md-padding" flex="60"> <img class="md-whiteframe-z1" src="../../images/projects/qwert/chip1.png"> <!--        <a class="youtubeContainer md-whiteframe-z1" ob-lazytube href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ">Keyboard cat</a>--> <!--
