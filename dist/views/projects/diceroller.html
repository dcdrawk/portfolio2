The goal was to take an app idea and create something completely <strong>unique and experimental</strong>. I decided to create an app that allowed users to roll 3D dice using unique gestures and movements. It requires a mobile phone with multi-touch <em>or</em> an accelerometer to use.</p> </div> <div class="third"> <h3>Process</h3> <p>We were given two weeks to reinvent an app with unique gestures. I decided to use <strong><a href="#" target="_blank">threeJS</a></strong> and, <strong><a href="#" target="_blank">physiJS</a></strong> libraries, which allowed me to create 3D objects complete with physics. My source of inspiration was the dice effect from the classic board game <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Trouble_(board_game)" target="_blank">Trouble.</a></strong></p> </div> <div class="fourth"> <h3>Result</h3> <p>This assignment was a true test of my JavaScript skills. After two weeks I had a working prototype that was able to use two different kinds of dice (d4 and d6). The dice can be rolled via a <strong>pinch gesture</strong>, or by <strong>moving the device</strong> up and down.</p> </div> </div> <div class="imgGallery md-padding" flex="33"> <img class="md-whiteframe-z1" src="images/projects/diceroller/diceroller-screen.jpg"> <!--        <a class="youtubeContainer md-whiteframe-z1" ob-lazytube href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ">Keyboard cat</a>--> <!--
