The content was outdated, and the layout was unintuitive. Starting from scratch, I built this website using my knowledge of <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>.</p> </div> <div class="third"> <h3>Process</h3> <p>Early in the design process, I started with a number of hand-drawn sketches to help communicate my overall design vision to my team of co-workers. Then, I moved onto a wireframe prototype using <a href="#" target="_blank">Axure</a>, which helped me understand the overall structure and visual layout of the design I had envisioned.</p> <p>After a few iterations, I was ready to translate my design into code. Using <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>Html5 Blank</strong> as my starting point, I was able to use feedback and my prototypes to guide the way.</p> </div> </div> <div class="imgGallery md-padding" flex="50" flex-sm="100" flex-order-sm="1"> <img class="main-img md-whiteframe-z1" src="images/websites/esebc1.jpg"> <ng-gallery images="gallery"> </ng-gallery> </div> </div> </div> </div>
