        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>ScrollBinder is a character planner app for the popular table-top game, <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>. Created as part of a mobile design course, we were given the task of creating a web app that also utilized web services.

        <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>Initially, I had to decide which framwork to use. I settled upon <strong>Angular JS</strong>, and decided to make an app which followed <strong>Google's Material Design Specs</strong>. The first phase of development consisted of creating a working app that could track player stats and traits. The second phase included adding Google's Realtime API to allow groups of players to keep track of important adventure details.</p>

          <h3>Result</h3>
          <p>ScrollBinder successfully reimagined the DnD experience by bringing. The <strong>responsive design</strong> allows it to work on any device, which greatly improves accessibility. I shared this app with my personal DnD group, and they continue to give me positive reviews and constructive feedback.</p>
